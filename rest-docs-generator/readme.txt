This package has first been developed to be included to swagger.
See https://github.com/pilhuhn/swagger-core/tree/apt

As the pull request ( https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/pull/28 ) was not
 successful ( so far ) I've put the sources here, so we can continue
 with documentation generation for the REST api.

We may consider to remove the generator when the general Swagger adds the
generator.
